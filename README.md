# LP/CP Programming Contest 2023

The traditional [LP/CP Programming Contest](https://lpcp-contest.github.io/) will be run **on site** during ICLP 2023.
It will be a two hours session, taking place on Thursday, 13 July, from 16:30 to 18:30.
The LP/CP Programming Contest 2023 will be held in person, with each team consisting of up to three participants, and is hosted at the ICLP 2023 conference venue, the Imperial College London.

**Results, stats and winner** will be announced shortly after the contest at the ICLP 2023 conference banquet.

The contest combines some features of Prolog programming contest, Answer Set Programming (ASP) Model and Solve contest, and Constraint Programming (CP) Model and Solve contest.
A variety of systems can be used in the competition, and as in the previous edition participants are not constrained to use a single system and can also combine declarative and imperative programming languages.
Submitted solutions are expected to have a declarative predominant core.

Input and output format of problems will be provided according to some easy-to-parse representation, and similarly output must be provided according to some easy-to-write format.
(Please, have a look at the [previous edition](https://github.com/alviano/lpcp-contest-2022) of the contest to get an idea of the input and output format.)

More detailed information about the technical contest infrastructure will be announced here as it becomes available.


## Systems

Any declarative problem solving language or system can be used.
In particular, a Docker image where the systems

* Ciao Prolog: http://ciao-lang.org
* ECLiPSe Prolog: http://eclipseclp.org
* GNU Prolog: http://gprolog.org
* SWI-Prolog: http://www.swi-prolog.org
* XSB Prolog: http://xsb.sourceforge.net
* IDP: https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/pages/software/idp
* MiniZinc: http://www.minizinc.org
* Picat: http://picat-lang.org
* Potassco: https://potassco.org

are installed is available from the 2019 edition of the contest.
Details on the installation and usage of the Docker image can be found [here](https://github.com/lpcp-contest/docker-lpcpsys).

However, usage of the Docker image is optional, and other systems can be run as well. When needed, we will ask for some help to run your solutions.


## Scoring

Participants will be ranked by **number of solved instances**.
A solution is valid as soon as it does not produce wrong answers for the tested instances.

In case of an **optimization problem**, the best solution(s) for an instance provided by some participant will be awarded a point. Correct yet suboptimal answers are not considered wrong but won't receive points for the problem instance under consideration.

Ties are broken by time of the last submissions contributing some points.
Further ties are broken by cumulative execution time.

Participants will receive feedback on the number of solved instances and on errors of their submissions.
As a general suggestion, **submit solutions as soon as you have them**.


## Registration

The registration will work by email with the following content:

* Team name;
* List of up to three participants and their affiliations;
* One or more email addresses to receive feedback.

The email address for the registration will be announced here soon.


## Submission

We plan to use [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/) for the submission of solutions.

Please make sure that you have an EasyChair account for being ready to submit.
