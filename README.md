# LP/CP Programming Contest 2023

[The traditional LP/CP Programming Contest](https://lpcp-contest.github.io/) will be run **on site** during ICLP 2023.
It will be a two hours session, taking place on Thursday, 13 July, from 16:30 to 18:30.
The LP/CP Programming Contest 2023 will be held in person, with each team consisting of up to three participants, and is hosted at the ICLP 2023 conference venue, the Imperial College London.

**Results, stats and winner** will be announced shortly after the contest at the ICLP 2023 conference banquet.

The contest combines some features of Prolog programming contest, Answer Set Programming (ASP) Model and Solve contest, and Constraint Programming (CP) Model and Solve contest.
A variety of systems can be used in the competition, and as in the previous edition participants are not constrained to use a single system and can also combine declarative and imperative programming languages.
Submitted solutions are expected to have a declarative predominant core.

Input and output format of problems will be provided according to some easy-to-parse representation, and similarly output must be provided according to some easy-to-write format.
(Please, have a look at the [previous edition](https://github.com/alviano/lpcp-contest-2022) of the contest to get an idea of the input and output format.)

More detailed information about the technical contest infrastructure will be announced here as it becomes available.


## Systems

TBA


## Scoring

Participants will be ranked by **number of solved instances**.
A solution is valid as soon as it does not produce wrong answers for the tested instances.

Ties are broken by time of the last submissions contributing some points.
Further ties are broken by cumulative execution time.

Participants will receive feedback on the number of solved instances and on errors of their submissions.
As a general suggestion, **submit solutions as soon as you have them**.
